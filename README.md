## Description

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. This is a great way to take advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application purpose is. A well-developed README will help you stand out compared to other developers. This README generator was created using node js. With this README generator, you no longer need to create a professional README from scratch. Simply answer a few questions and watch as a README is automatically created.

## Installation

The instructions-of-README-generator was first created in repository in GitHub. The repository was cloned into local desktop. The update version of the software was uploaded. The index.js file was created and pushed into repository GitHub. Any changes made to local was added, committed, and pushed to repository.

## Credits

I would like to thank Ben Martin for assisting me with this project.
